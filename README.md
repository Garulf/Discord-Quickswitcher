# How-to get API key:

In order to retrieve an API key you need to login Discord's web app and open your browser's "dev tools"

Once your dev tools are open simply type anything into Discord's message box and watch for a "Typing" event to be recorded by your dev tools.
You will find the API key you need under the "Authorization" header as shown below:
